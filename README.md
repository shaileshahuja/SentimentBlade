A <i>sentiment analysis engine</i>, written in <i>Python</i>.   
Given a review, the system classifies it into <b>postive</b>, <b>negative</b> or <b>neutral</b>.
It is possible to crawl reviews of a certain restaurant and get an analysis of the reviews for that restaurant. However, it is for educational puposes only, as Yelp TOC may not allow usage of their content by other parties.  
The other possibility is to crawl movie reviews from IMDB (<a href=https://github.com/shaileshahuja/SentimentBlade/issues/8>to be implemented</a>). The algorithm also needs to be optimised for movie reviews, using an automated algorithm (<a href=https://github.com/shaileshahuja/SentimentBlade/issues/9>impact training</a>). 


<b>The in-depth analysis of each review includes:</b>  
1. Adjectives highlighting, thus clearly indicating where the review focuses on  
2. Scoring of each review to indicate how strongly the opinion has been presented  
3. Summary of overall scores of the restaurant
