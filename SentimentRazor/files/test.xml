        <review>I have wanted to dine here for quite some time and haven't made it yet. I just called to make a reservation and so far they have only 1 star. The hostess was rude and did not ask any questions, but waited for me to have to tell her everything. I paused briefly and she said, "Hello??" She was impatient, interrupted me to say "Hold Please," then put me on hold without asking and rushed me off the phone. I asked for a good table since it was my dad's birthday and she begrudgingly said "She'd put in a request." Total snot. So far, NOT so good. I'm trying to get into Slanted Door(which is totally full) so I may not end up trying this place next weekend after all.</review>

        <review>WARNING THIS RESTAURANT is for 50 year old WHITE people. SF is usually known for the wide variety of diverse cultures and people, unfortunately this restaurant is NOT.1,406 reviews.. 4.5 stars.. what a bunch of lies.. this is beyond over hyped.. if you want to spending $150+ on a good restaurant don't waste your time and look at other highly rated yelp restaurantsOMG... I wished I had sorted the reviews based on lowest. Oh man I will never trust yelp sort again!All the negative reviews about this was true. Goodness if I had only taken more time to research how bad this restaurant was.. then I would have avoid this mess to begin with.Before you continue reading this review, please note that we are a married couple in our late 20's dressed in formal attire.CONS:-The man who seated us, probably the owner was absolutely rude. He didn't greet us, asked us how we were doing or even smiled during the entire waiting/seating process.- The seating is horrible.. my husband had to walk down two rows of tables before he could even sit down. I have to say that the seating layout did not make any sense at all. The weirdest thing was that we arrived pretty early around 5:45pm and they sited us in the most tightest spot possible, I was literally 2 inches away from the man next to me. When the man next to me was cutting his lamb chop he bumped into me a few times and excused him self. He even made some funny remarks about how cramped the space was. There were plenty of spaces available but I guess we didn't make the cut :/- SERVICE = what service? The waitress, a white blond lady with a bun pulled so tight it looked as though she just had one too many botox trips looked mean and off putting. She was the rudest server I have ever had. Note that I have eaten at fine establishments, such as Gary Danko, Michael Mina, and Chapeau just to name a few and for the price I am paying the service should match the food. When my husband asked what type of fish it was the dumbass waitress said well it's grilled and other is roasted.. no shit. What am I ten? He asked what fish is it.. not how it was prepared .. it was clearly written on the menu roasted and grill. I just looked at my husband like WTF?!?! are you kidding me?Now why do I say she is a racist? Well since we were sat so damn close to the couple next to us I could hear everything she said to them, she was warm and friendly, she brought comped desserts and oil/butter for their bread. Our table was never checked up on us, avoided us, and talked down to us as though we didn't have enough class or money to eat here. The bus boy/bread boy even had more class and politeness than her asking us how our day was and where we came from..-The food was really good but super oily.. there was no oil or butter for the bread.. the bread tasted as though it was left from yesterday. Sorry for the long review but here are the key take ways-Don't go here if your race is other than white, because they stick their noses in the air and treat you like trash because this establishment is only meant for white people-Over priced foods for something you can go to your local greek fast food cart -RUDE service from a waitress that doesn't even know what is on the menu.. that's just sadEven though the service was rude we decided to give a 25% tip, but I now regret doing so because as we left there was no thank you or even eye contact recognizing that we had left.. Kokkari Estiatorio you have left a sour taste in my mouth and I will NEVER return again!</review>

        <review>Food is excellent. Hostess is very rude and ruined our evening. Would not return until a new hostess is hired. Even with a reservation the hostess will make you wait if you dont appear to have money. So dont forget your watches and coats!</review>

        <review>Look, we tried. We were ready to like it. We were ready to enjoy the fancy food, the fancier wine selection, the fireplace, the lot. But no... the weak link won:LOUSY SERVICE RUINS EVERYTHING"Is there space at the bar?""Yes, a few people are about to be seated, enjoy!"HAH! After much effort to forcibly inject ourselves into the unyielding bar crowd, we hoped we wouldn't have to fight to get the couple drinks we wanted, plus some quick noshes to munch on. But NO! After too much waiting at all points of our visit, we realized the only way to get anything was do to it ourselves: grab our own menus, force them to take our order, beg for bread to accompany our late food, serve our own oil for our dry bread...HELLO? KOKKARI? Do you have much experience with this whole SERVING thing?What's the problem? Are they understaffed? No, two bartenders behind their non-giant bar, and plenty of fresh-faced servers buzzing around us......just nobody that actually makes a difference. Or nobody willing to drop their attitude and actually pour a decent drink.Oh wait, I have to admit one reasonably attentive person -- the server who brought out our two, tiny spanokopita triangles (for $8). He was somewhat generous, even if the serving amounts weren't.No need to go back there again.</review>

        <review>After being in Greece for 6 weeks, I was disappointed. I had hoped to find something more authentic. Flatbread with caramelized onions (and kalamata olives)? Not Greek. Olive oil on the table when bread is served - Italian, not Greek. Only two Greek red wines by the glass? I can buy the same at K and L Wines. I am dreaming of the day when this place rivals Cafe Abyssinia in Athens...The only thing they really excel on is decor...and location...but even the decor did not seem to me to be Greek at all.</review>

        <review>One word describes Kokkari:FRAUD. My husband and I and another couple were there last night for dinner. This is a "Greek" restaurant which has only one brand of retsina on its wine list. With the exception of the fried zucchini flowers, all of the dishes we had (about 16 various ones from appetizers to deserts) were either excessively accommodated to and reconfigured for American tastes (e.g., galaktoboureko with pineapple and coconut;ouzo sorbet;rice pudding the consistency of paste, etc.) and/ or very poorly prepared (e.g., overdone, undrained, tasteless greens; greasy, rubbery smelts; dry, stinky, tasteless fish--both main course varieties; overly-spiced lamb shank with overdone, overly-spiced orzo, etc., etc., etc.) . This is certainly not authentic Greek food by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, the prices for these faux Hellenic delicacies were absurdly high considering the poor quality of the fare. It is our opinion that this establishment is of the trendy, vacuous variety, an evening's amusement for the very naive and pretentious;a popular stage on which to see and be seen, a in short, a social scene pretending to be a restaurant.  It makes one both angry and ashamed to be a Greek.  Shame on the owners, if they are Greeks, which I frankly doubt. They are certainly taking the San Francisco eating public for a ride.</review>

        <review>The food was okay but the bar tender had a nasty attitude. I got the linguini with lamb; the bread was good. He did not even have the courtesy to welcome me as a guest, or introduce to the specials, etc. He seemed like a real work of art. I don't think I'm going to go to this place anytime soon!</review>

        <review>This restaurant currently has 1912 reviews with a very high average. I can understand why. I have eaten there many times and enjoyed the beauty of the dining room and some pretty terrific food. So why one star?  In my enthusiasm for this restaurant I attempted to make reservations for some significantly important people at my job who I wanted to impress. I called Private Dining about reserving their small room for 10. She was unbelievably unfriendly. Annoyed with me for calling it felt like. I asked her to give me an estimate including tax and gratuity as I had to prepare an expense report. Pointedly, she remarked " I don't have a calculator." Then a take it or leave it pregnant pause. Okay, so I wanted to be fair to Kokkari and wrote this to their General Manager via a private email in the hopes I would get a response. Some kind of acknowledgment that this was an anomaly for that restaurant. No response.So now, I am steering people to Perbacco and Wayfare Tavern for this price point. Too bad. Such a nice restaurant. I don't think they are worried. After all 1912 happy diners, and they are usually sold out.</review>

        <review>Tony a server added a couple bucks to his tip! That's technically stealing. I hate it when servers do that! I notified the manager when I got my receipt. I'm sure they'll do whats right...but BAD TONY! His actions reflect poorly on the whole business.</review>

        <review>I really wanted to like this place, as I love Mediterranean.1. Food: the food is good, a little overpriced, but quality was still good enough. I really enjoyed the Zucchini Cake appetizers. 3.5 stars2. Ambiance: A little crowded. I could feel the breath of the people next to me. 3 stars 3. Service: Hostess was nice, and other helpers were nice -- but my waiter was horrendous. She was condescending to my party. That already was a big slap in the face. She definitely was not attentive to our table at all -- my ice tea never was refilled until I asked another waiter. It took me 3 waiters to find her so she can get me the check.....yes 3 waiters, and 2 of the waiters couldn't even find her. 1 star.</review>

        <review>I've spent some time in Greece with my Greek husband so I do know Greek food. This place is overrated and overpriced for the taste and quality of food that you get . I had dinner here twice this year (not my choice but my out of town Greek friends wanting to check it out) and both times were underwhelming. The food were just way too SALTY! On a positive note, SERVICE was always professional.</review>

        <review>Kokkari has very nice ambience and the staff are prompt and polite, but they serve below average Greek food at best. The Greek salad was okay, but the octopus appetizer was lame, and the saganaki was much too salty and soaked in grease...it was obviously pan-fried rather than lit ablaze with brandy and with an accompanying "Opa!" My wife's fish was very average as well. Definitely not authentic Greek food, but a romantic place I guess you could say. If you think this is good Greek food, you haven't been to Greek Town in Chicago!</review>

        <review>Iwwent here a while back and wanted to give it a second go before I wrote a review. Anyways, if I was only reviewing the food I'd give it 4 stars or more but lets talk about service:I love attentive servers but this fella was hounding us to no end and was constantly tryign to hurry up our meal. So dissapointing. Took away from the whole evening. At this rate I'll never go back. When your dropping that much cash you should be allowed to take your time.</review>

        <review>Underwhelming, at best.I am amazed that so many people are impressed by this restaurant. The food is good, but not THAT good. The fish is awful, and they managed to dry out my duck - an amazing feat! The atmosphere is good, as is the location, but I really fail to see how any of that can compensate for the underwhelming food. When I go out to dinner, I want to eat food that either a) I cannot make my self and/or b) cannot make as well as the professionals in white. Here's the kicker, though. THE LAMB WASN'T EVEN ALL THAT GOOD! Everybody and their mother says "Oh the lamb this, the lamb that..." Whatever. My girlfriend ordered it and I was glad that I had ordered my poorly-cooked, yet still tasty, duck. As we exited the restaurant, my wallet significantly lighter, I could not help but reflect on all the better meals I've made for myself and had others prepare for me.  P.S. They don't even cut their own fish - it's delivered portion cut! No quality control!</review>

        <review>So I've called 3 different reservation staff, all of them told me to wait a month since I can only book a month in advance. I had told them that I have a huge group to book. I volunteered as much information as I can. Did they? No...After waiting a month, I was told that it's full. What?! I called first thing in the morning.The reason that they are already booked, is that they actually do take reservations more than a month in advance, except you must meet the minimum of $2500. Now, why none of the 3 staff told me, I don't know. They could've told me that there is a large booking already. Why did that have to be a fing secret?I am so irritated by the lack of explanation. Please put someone on the phone that is actually helpful with information!!!I couldve booked other restaurants, now I have to scramble and find a different restaurant when I couldve booked it in October! :(:(:(</review>

        <review>The food is very good but, the tables are too close and the noise level is too much.I imagine dinner at the "community table" when one is feeling social and boisterous would work well but, even a private table in the front of the restaurant is too loud for a quiet celebration for 2.</review>

        <review>Our group of 6 showed up early for an early reservation planning to have a drink in the bar, but the hostess said that our table was ready and we were welcome to enjoy a cocktail at our table. She was very friendly and showed us to our seats. The restaurant is very nicely laid out and decorated and the seating/dining area was very comfortable. Our server, Pacshalis, showed up and asked if we would like to order appetizers. We said that we would like to have cocktails first and he seemed to get a bit miffed over this. He reluctantly took our drink orders and returned after they were served to take our dinner orders. He had trouble remembering the specials and when asked some questions, such as whether their lamb was American or not he asked, "What do you mean?" We said is the lamb raised in America or NZ or some other place? He said something like, "It is raised in America if that is what you like." Yeah, right. He seemed like he was being bothered and was very snotty. I tried to order some wine for the table, but he just walked away without acknowledging anything. He ended up standing at a waiter's station maybe 10 feet away from our table so I got up and went to order some wine. He wouldn't even look at me or answer me and pretended to be studying the order list he was carrying. It wasn't until another waiter asked me if he could help me that our waiter finally acknowledged me and took the order.Our food was a mixed bag. It was all nicely presented, but some was very tasty and as described and some was clearly inferior and not what we were told.Our party ordered two of the specials that evening: A grilled veal chop cooked rare, and a rotisserie grilled pork loin chop. The veal chop was baby beef, not veal, even though we asked if it was really veal or baby beef and were told that it was definitely veal. The rib bone was well over an inch across, which was way too large for veal, and they had cut half of the meat off so the actual chop was about 1/2" thick or less and then cooked it till it was overdone and chewy. The pork chop was not a chop at all - it was pork shoulder - and contained mostly large chunks of fat. Both diners were very disappointed in these "specials" that were in the $35+ range.Two of us had the grilled quail, which was very tasty, and two others had a couple of traditional Greek entrees, which they enjoyed. And, the grilled octopus appetizer was fantastic.We may return, but would definitely like a different server - one who knows the menu, is honest, and is friendly.</review>

        <review>I don't know why so many people love this place....I found lame guys sitting at the bar talking "politics" and surly know it all bartenders laughing when you ask for a not-sweet Riesling, also I'm not that into Greek food so take my food critique with a grain of salt, but I think the frozen Greek food from trader joes is better...plus I accidentally pronounced Spanakopita skank-o-pita and embarrassed myself immensely (it happens with you get dyslexics drunk). Plus a few stars for the cozy atmosphere and good Greek wine (yes bartender, you were right about the Riesling)</review>

        <review>I loved the beginning of the meal, but the reason I'm giving this two stars is because of the main course. The waiter recommended the roasted lamb (all parts) with crispy skin, roasted in the fireplace right there. It tasted like it was boiled, was fatty and inedible. I couldn't get the rancid-like taste our of my mouth for the rest of the evening.Should have ordered the fish.We will not return.</review>

        <review>Probably deserves more than 2 stars but i can't get myself to give it three. The service was fine. We had the room to ourselves upstairs. You know the one next to the restrooms that people have to take the elevator up to.Its not because its expensive, or because of the presentation or the service. Prices are nothing compared to gas prices. Service was pretty good. Portion size was rather large and they look good. Its just all so "ok".  Also, the ribeye was extremely salty. extremely.</review>

        <review>{{shrug}} I really wanted to like Kokkari, and had high expectations. A friend and I went for a late lunch after shopping in the city. We arrived at 2:00, were seated quickly, and were presented with a basket of bread and a small dish of salt. We requested olive oil for dipping, and then waited...and waited...and waited. The lunch crowd had died down, the restaurant was not crowded at all, so it was puzzling. A party was seated next to us, and the same thing happened. No olive oil, even after requesting it. My friend and I ordered four small dishes to split. When the first two arrived, they finally brought the olive oil, after we'd filled up on dry bread (we were starving). The zucchini cakes were delicious, and the dolmathes were -- well, they were dolmathes. We ordered a small dish of prawns in sauce, and the prawns had an artificial, metallic taste I couldn't place. We also got a dish of fried cheese, which was tasty, but very, very salty, and swimming in oil. Even splitting it, my friend couldn't finish her half. She had a glass of wine with lunch, and we both had coffee, and split a dessert. The tab? $45 each (including tip) for lunch. Not cheap.I have been to Evvia in Palo Alto and had a much better experience. Also, another thing happened that really gets on my nerves. It's very irritating when an inexperienced waitperson barges into your table with nary an "excuse me" when you are clearly in the middle of a conversation, cuts short your discussion, and blocks your view of your lunch companion with arms, dishes, glasses, etc. If I'm paying almost $50 for lunch, I want to be treated a little better than that.</review>

        <review>Kokkari has wonderful ambiance and service! However, their food is overpriced, lacks originality and flavor.My friend and I both ordered a grilled fish dish. Mine was flavorless and full of bones.There are much better restaurants at this price point in SF that you should go for a tasty, memorable meal besides Kokkari.</review>

        <review>A dissapointing evening at Kokkari. We went after the Symphony; our reservations were for 11 pm and the place was packed! Although we were seated right away and had excellent service, the food let us down. In fact, the only winners were the olives, bread and syrah (Barossa Valley). I've read others' reviews and can't figure out why our food experience was so different. Everything was doused with too much olive oil and had little to no taste. Our small plate choices: Bruschetta on barley loaf (a special), Tongue (tender but blah, another special), Smelt (nicely fried but little taste other than salt and the aioli was overwhelming), Grilled Calamari stuffed with Feta, Fennel &amp; Orange with Black Olives (very oily with not a hint of seasoning); Grilled Meatballs with Spiced Tomato Sauce &amp; Greek Yogurt (just OK). I love the ambiance of the place, but won't be returning because of the food.</review>

        <review>Definitely caters to the bombastic Business District crowd with the bland and overpriced, uninspired entrees. The appetizers are good, but some are hit an miss (avoid the flavorless large white beans). Dessert was OK; the baklava was actually not good, but the wrapped custard was divine. Service was discreet and without attitude.</review>

        <review>First the good: the food was amazing. Even for a vegetarian, I found a few things on the menu to enjoy, although I did feel like I was missing out on what made this place great. And dessert was delicious. The ambiance here is also amazing. Now the bad: I've never felt so disrespected by a server in my life. The first problem was that I didn't drink wine. When he found out I was vegetarian, he basically told me there was no point in me being there. I took it all in good humor until he made a comment to the next table about people that don't eat meat or drink wine being unbearable. Even the couple at the table next to us said they couldn't believe how rude our server was. Every one else at the restaurant was super nice but even with the great food, I couldn't recommend Kokkari in good conscience.</review>

        <review>The food was good (typical Kokkari fare) but the service is awful. We came with a large party and were served from large platters by the waiter, who would reach over the backs of our chairs to do so. The number of times we were dripped on was just ridiculous. The final insult was when the bus boy came to fill water glasses in the same manner as if he was serving slop to pigs, with the glass literally overflowing, water everywhere, and he strolled nonchalantly away. It was a large table, so you already had your tip, but honestly, couldn't you at least try to give decent service...?</review>

        <review>I suppose this review is not going to sit well with the 800 people who reviewed this place before me. Well, the food at Kokkari didn't sit well with me, so I think it's only fair that I speak the truth.Yesterday was my third visit to Kokkari, but first since 2002. I remembered this place being a lot better, but it seems that memory failed me once again. My friend turned 32 (or sixteen twice, as he put it), and he asked me if I could take him to Kokkari. We showed up at 6 pm, and the place was packed. Recession? What recession?As soon as you open the heavy wooden doors, you find yourself in the quiet opulence of a ritzy country club . Dim lights, wide, tapestry-upholstered armchairs, antique-looking torchieres, heavy pillars - the ambiance is just perfect. Hmm, what's that in the back? A rotisserie?  They don't have those at the country clubs. Some tables were more secluded, but ours was a few uncomfortable inches away from our neighbors'. Getting to the bathroom was an adventure. I had to walk all the way to the elevator and take it to the ground floor to get to the bathroom. Fortunately, one of the waiters walked me to the elevator because I would have been lost on the way to the bathroom. The bathroom was my favorite part of the experience. It was fantastic! Old Greek vases adorned the walls, and quiet Mediterranean music was playing. I was waiting for the belly dancers to show up, but alas, it didn't happen.The service at Kokkari was very professional, but not warm or friendly. My friend had walked in to the restaurant with his Starbucks cup and set it on the table. The manager showed up and offered a couple of suggestions: throw it out, warm it up, bring him a cup. He took the Starbucks cup and reappeared a few minutes later with my friend's berry chai in a coffee mug. They even reheated his drink. Nice, huh? Our waitress was nice, but it felt as though she was in a rush. In fact, I felt like I was rushed through the entire meal.. One can't open a restaurant bursting at the seams with ambiance and expect to funnel people in and out every 15 minutes. Our waitress did not offer to refill our iced tea and waters until the very end of the meal, although they did bring us more bread and olives.As you can probably tell, I am stalling so that I wouldn't have to talk about the food. The food was definitely not worth the price of admission. We started by sharing 3 appetizers. The much ballyhooed zucchini cakes (looked kind of like crab cakes) with yogurt weren't nearly as good as I had thought. In fact, they lacked flavor. The artichoke and eggplant skewer was not as good as advertised. The Spanakotiropita (filo pies with spinach, feta, leeks and dill) was the saving grace. They looked like Greek hamentashen, but tasted even better.My entree was downright horrible. I opted for the rotisserie of the day, which was pork. I told myself before coming to Kokkari that if they had roasted pork, I would order it. I remembered it being that good. Well, it wasn't. I got two pieces of pork: a chop cut and a bacon cut. The pork was drenched in fat, surrounded in fat, covered with fat and decorated with fat. The two pieces on top of my chop were two pieces of deep fried, salty pork fat. Ugh. The chop was OK near the fatty part, but the inside was dry and tasteless. The bacon cut was better, although when I cut out the fatty skin, I was left with nothing. The pork was served with roasted potatoes, swimming in a pork fat and oil mixture. UGH. To quote Joe Pesci's character from My Cousin Vinny: "Excuse me, you guys down here hear about the ongoing cholesterol problem in the country?"We split our two desserts. The flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream was rich but plain. It wasn't exciting or unique. The filo crepes with semolina custard and pistachio ice cream were very good. Semolina custard tasted kind of like chilled cream of wheat, but it seemed to work with that particular combination.So, the only two dishes that were good here were made with filo dough. I always say that anything deep fried tastes good, and our dinner was yet another example. The $138 ($118 + tip) we spent on dinner was way too much for the quality of food and the quality of service. It wasn't a good value, and it wasn't a particularly great meal. Add the cost of tums to relieve your heartburn, and Kokkari seems like a very expensive option. Too expensive for me to repeat anytime soon.</review>

        <review>whereas the chefs at kokkari are undisputed masters of the cooking and preparation of their chicken, beef and (most aptly) lamb dishes, their shortcomings are resounding in the vegetarian department. with few options and even fewer -desirable- options, this downside harks back to a patron's culinary theory - does a restaurant have to be good at -everything-? with the exception of steakhouses and seafood eateries, the answer would have to be yes. well-roundedness is easily worth two more stars.to make matters worse, all of my three visits to kokkari were on my firm's tab. essentially, if faced with the decision of having to choose my free meal of choice, i would stand by my aversion of this joint and head over to globe in a second.</review>

        <review>I was entirely underwhelmed. I'd heard such great things about this place that I was eagerly looking forward to when I finally got myself to go. First of all, we had a reservation, but still had to wait a good 30+ minutes, which was a bit frustrating (this was on a Thursday night). Then, all of the food was just incredibly underwhelming. I've decided this place must be great for meat-eaters because as a vegetarian I can't understand AT ALL what the hype is over. Also, the online menu was not what we got. I remember being excited to try the watermelon starter I'd read, but it wasn't on the menu for us. I think the best thing we tried was the flatbread, but even that wasn't amazing - simply better than the other dishes. The waitstaff was incredibly unattentive, as we had to try to flag him down for more water and the check. All in all, I thought this was one of the worst experiences I've had recently, but again, I think the food may be better for a non-vegetarian.</review>

        <review>I'm writing this review prematurely, but with the expectation that I'll follow-up with a full summary of the experience post-dining. I'm in the process of planning my dad's retirement dinner and, due to all the wonderful Yelp recommendations, chose Kokkari. It's a small affair, only 15 people. I have been on the phone with Kokkari 4 times in the last week each time speaking to a woman named Joanie. Joanie is not helpful or accommodating, she gives the impression that a larger party is an inconvenient hassle not a boon, she doesn't return my calls when promised and -- most annoyingly -- she talks over you while you're talking. How can you hear what I'm requesting if you are talking while I am? Her tone is not conciliatory when she has to decline a request, and gives the "Well, we're a busy restaurant" line which - frankly - applies to a ton of places who have the good sense not to actually say that to a customer.After a week of phone calls and, finally, an authorization from her manager that, yes, it is okay if we dine here, we finally have a reservation at the only time that wasn't 5:30pm. We're booked at 8:45pm. My point of writing this is that it struck me that even the process (and here I really mean *process*) of booking a reservation is an indicator of how the actual dinner may go. Joanie has successfully given me enough pause to hold my reservation while looking for other options because I lack confidence in our being seated on time, and the demeanor and warmth of those interacting with us. If this were just my husband and me, it wouldn't be so weighted but for an important event like a retirement it causes some hesitation.In short - if you have a small party, avoid calling and just use Open Table to book. This place is not good for large groups (even at the Kouzina, which I requested.)I really hope I take back everything I've said because the dinner was so amazing, but just these four calls have already made me look at Kokkari askew.</review>

        <review>We have been to Kokkari 5 times and always had amazing food and service. We went there last week to celebrate my husbands birthday. The food was just okay but worst of all was the service. We waited for drinks way too long (25 minutes) after being seated. Even then, we had to get up and ask the waiter to take our drink order. We actually had to ask for our waiter twice during our dinner. The waiter explained that there had been a rush of orders when we arrived. No excuse. Don't just ignore us and force us to ask for service. The food was also very slow to arrive to our table after we ordered. For the prices they charge, I expect much better.</review>

        <review>I'm really not sure what folks are raving about. Our most recent visit to Kokkari was very disappointing. We went mainly because it was nostalgic. We had one of our first dates there. Unfortunately, the food this time was mediocre, the service was slow and they sat us in the breezeway where I was freezing. All that for a very expensive meal. That was likely our last trip to Kokkari.</review>

        <review>I have to say I was a little disappointed. I live right across the street from Kokkaris and it was the first place everyone recommended to eat at. Pretty pricey and the menu is limited. It's a fun place to grab a drink after work though if you can stand the suits and snobby environment.</review>

        <review>Ugh... This place is SOOOO O V E R   R A T E D when it comes to the foodThe service is GREAT and they treat you really nice, I just think the food is not that great and kinda flavorless. The only thing that was kinda good was the lamb chops. Everything else was pretty unimpressive.... Maybe I just don't like greek food? I think the best part of my meal was the chocolate sundae they served at the end of the meal. Here's what we orderedSmelt appetizer - meh, I hated it. Felt like i was eating fried bait from someone's tackle boxLamb Ribletts- they tasted OK, but I felt like a dog eating left oversLamb Chops - Pretty good, but I feel like I've had just as good else whereRibeye - pretty good, but not any different than any other really good steak houseChocolate Sundae - yummy :)Wine : Neal, cab - One of the best I've had in a long time ..but $90 ouchThat's my summary... Don't think I'd go here again. It's just not that great. I'd rather try some place new.</review>

        <review>My husband and I were not impressed with the food at Kokkari. Our meal started and ended on a good note. The zucchini cakes and pan fried cheese (Saghanaki) were tasty. The cheese tasted like Parmesan. Loved the custard filled filo (Galaktoboureko). We were disappointed with our entrees, however. My husband's lamb chops were overseasoned, and my quail was oily. I barely even touched my side of vegetables.</review>

        <review>Flamed cheese and fried smelt is what earned the 3 stars. Waitress was off settling cold. We wanted to try the daily special but were informed 10 minutes after trying to order it that it was sold out. Note to waitress, never judge a book by it's cover....</review>

        <review>Kokkari's atmosphere is great and their food is alright. I'd be happier if it were the other way around, but so it goes. Then again, I decided to get a little adventurous and eat a tongue. I also checked out a few tamer foods (saghanaki, dolmathes, etc) and they were okay. Not outstanding. I'll probably go somewhere else the next time I'm looking for Greek food in the Financial District.</review>

        <review>Very swanky place. Great if your parents are taking you out to dinner. Not really my style. The food is delicious. But everything was a little too rich for my blood. I went with my aunt and was dressed in jeans and a nice shirt and still felt out of place. The food is great and so is the service. Just be aware that it is on the fancy side.</review>

        <review>should have gone for the Ravioli rather than the lamb chops. (here's why:)ambiance would have been amazing if the place was about 1/20th of the size. would be much better for parties of 8-10.we got the Zucchini Cakes - with cucumber &amp; mint yogurt dressing - which were amazing!!!! We were disappointed with their beer selection - I mean, nothing on tap - not so cool. Oh don't get the Tomato Salad - heirloom tomatoes &amp; purslane with feta cheese - the cheese they used was cold and a block cube that didn't blend well or compliment the heirloom.I got the Arnisia Paidakia - grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette &amp; Kokkari potatoes - potatoes were okay but not flavorful enough, esp being greek, but the lamb chops were very flavorful. although i got bored of them after one and moved on to my date's Makaronia me Horta - ravioli of braised greens &amp; feta with mushrooms, pine nuts &amp; summer squash - which i will admit, captured my heart after one bite - and should have gone for the Ravioli rather than the lamb chops.</review>

        <review>the grilled octopus is AMAZING! it was juicy, tender &amp; the best part of my meal. another plus is that the restaurant offers cute 1/2 bottles of wine...great for the light weights who don't want to finish a full bottle. my friend &amp; i came here but we both don't like lamb, so our choices were very limited (so limited that I even considered ordering a vegetarian dish). he had the pork chop special, which was a humongous portion. i had one of their fish specials, which was just average. as a lazy eater, i didn't enjoy it that much b/c it wasn't de-boned.the seating space was also very tight and limited. we were sitting literally a foot away from the couple next to us. it's kind of fun to unintentionally eavesdrop, but sometimes you just need some space!</review>

        <review>Made reservations here on yelp because of the good reviews and the need to take my girlfriend out for a nice dinner. When I first got here, the lady in the front quickly checked for my reservation and within 2 minutes, we were seated. I've never had Greek/Mediterranean food before so I wasn't too sure what I was getting myself into.The waiter was an older guy and he made a remark about my girlfriend because she was on her iphone, which seemed kind of rude at first but I guess that's just his personality and he was just trying to be friendly. He was a nice guy and all but just different from the usual waiters. The way he serves his customers is informal/unprofessional, with an attitude that one would use when serving guests at his house I guess. I don't know whether to look at it as a good thing or a bad. Anyways, onto the food. We started off with the Kalamata Pita, which is flatbread with Kalamata olives, tomato, caramelized onion &amp; myzithra. It pretty much looks like pizza but it had a different flavor which makes it stand out versus pizza that you would pick up at a pizza joint. It was really good actually, one of the better dishes that we had for the night.The 2nd appetizer that we ordered was the Octapodaki tou Yiorgou, which is grilled octopus with lemon, oregano &amp; olive oil.. For $13, I expected a bit more but I guess I should've seen it coming seeing that its delicacy food. If you're looking for big portions, stay away from this plate. It literally tickled my tummy. Wasn't too great in my opinion.For the main dish, I ordered the Anisia Paidakia, which is lamb chops grilled with lemon-oregano vinaigrette &amp; Kokkari potatoes. This was the plate that everyone was talking about on yelp and honestly, I expected a bit more. Maybe it's cause I'm not used to eating Greek/Mediterranean food but it certainly didn't WOW me. It had a little too much lemon in it, which made the potatoes extremely soury. The lambchops itself were decent but nothing to gloat over. My girlfriend ordered the Kotopoulo Souvlas, which was the lemon-oregano chicken roasted with spring onions &amp; potatoes and she said the same thing: too soury. A bit too much lemony for our taste but others may think otherwise. Overall, I probably wouldn't be back unless friends were to come here for a birthday or something because I'm not too big of a fan of Greek food.***Parking***: Street parking/valet.Cash/Credit accepted here.</review>

        <review>I've been here on two occasions for lunch. I've always seemed to have an okay experience, probably because I may not be into greek food. However, it's a great place for business lunches and dates if you like greek food. Pros:- Large and spacious restaurant- Wonderful and warm ambiance- Knowledgeable staff- Vegetarian friendly Cons:- Small selection on menuRecommendations:- Zucchini Cakes- Make sure you know what a moussaka is before you try it, I was trying to be bold and hardly touched it- Watermelon &amp; Feta are very refreshing - Galaktoboureko (dessert)</review>

        <review>I took my bf to Kokkari for his birthday. Parking was a breeze which is a huge plus in my book for a SF restaurant. The atmosphere inside was very nice and the service was very good. I didn't have much of an appetite that night, so we didn't order that much. Sparaggia - oven roasted asparagus with feta, dill &amp; lemon vinaigrette - $8.50- nothing specialGarides Yuvetsi - wood oven roasted prawns with tomato &amp; feta cheese - $12.75- too salty and the portion was very smallGaleos - pan roasted Pacific halibut steak, sweet corn &amp; peppers with fresh tomato &amp; olive sauce - $23.5- the halibut was very well cookedWhen I made the reservations, I told them that it was for my bf's birthday, so they asked me to spell his name and told me they would bring out a special dessert for him. When our meal ended, the waitress brought over the dessert menu. I was a bit confused and told her that we didn't want any dessert. About five minutes later, they brought out his birthday sundae.  On the plate, they spelled his name wrong. haha! Oh well, we both enjoyed the sundae immensely. I think it actually was my favorite part of the meal!3.5 starsI know 3.5 stars is a little harsh, but I really expected Kokkari to be amazing. I prefer Evvia, the sister restaurant in Palo Alto.</review>

        <review>Overall my experience at Kokkari went well. I went there for a quick lunch with some friends, but I was on a tight schedule. They were able to seat us rather quickly (without reservations and with a pleasant attitude) and had our food ready in no time flat. I was able to get back to work within an hour and a half (with travel time).The main issue I had dealt with our service: Our waitress was confused. . . really, really confused. . . she took forever to get us water, and kept messing up our drink orders. She then took away our drinks while we were still drinking them, and plates that we needed to use. . .Overall, it was a nice dining experience.</review>

        <review>I went with three friends for a hearty Greek meal and after the experience, I would suggest to those interested to simply enjoy the starters and a nice glass of wine. The wine list was lovely. The following mezethes were tasty: Kolokithokeftethes, Kalamata Pita and Gigantes. Unfortunately the Marouli Salata and Moussaka didn't have my dinner companions raving. We should have kept it simple.</review>

        <review>Considering this restaurant has such great reviews, it simply was impossible to live up to it's reputation. The lamb chops were reviewed to be the yummiest chops on earth, and although they were of exceptionally high quality, they were served luke warm and without exceptional seasoning. The sea bass, prepared roasted in tomatoes and fennel, was also luke warm and overwhelmingly seasoned. I could have made a similar dish at home. Still, the service was excellent, the restaurant decor very nice, and the atmosphere was loud and lively. The ingredients are very high quality, but the food isn't something I'd rave over. I like it but don't love it.</review>

        <review>Overrated. Yeah, that's about it. OK, Kokkari is a gorgeous restaurant in a really nice location. I had no idea Jackson St was so beautiful! The park on Front and Jackson is really pretty and there are a ton of nice condo buildings. Inside the restaurant the open fire and rotisserie are beautiful. But the food at Kokkari is just average... can get a better Greek meal at just about any good home style Greek place and for a fraction of the price. Most of the other items are typical steakhouse fare with a slight Greek twist. Sure it was Friday night, but the service was distracted and rather poor considering the fanciness ratio. I'm fairly disappointed considering that Kokkari had been on my bookmarks list since I moved to SF. I wouldn't refuse to go back, but it wouldn't be very high on the list either.</review>

        <review>Average food with great ambiance ambiance and great service. We would not go there again to have good food but would go again to have good time. Though I have to say that we are originally from Turkey and we have pretty high standards for good greek/turkish/mediterrean food. We had:appetizer: - grilled octopus (4 stars out of 5) - octopus was tender. after dipping it into olive oil that we asked on the side and adding salt, it was yummy. - tzatziki (5 stars) - a must get- wood oven roasted prawns (3 stars - they were shrimps more than prawns)- Greek salad (1 star) - big chunks of very cold tomato+cucumber pieces which did not taste like anything. Costco tomatoes and cucumbers taste much better. entree:- quails (1 star) - did not taste like anything to me but my husband said it was average.dessert: - baklava (4 stars) - the homemade praline ice cream that comes with baklava was awesome!- galaktoboureko (3 stars)Oh also, it is an extremely popular place. If you want to have dinner at a reasonably time, make sure to make a reservation couple of weeks before or otherwise you may end up having dinner at 10 at night like us :)</review>

        <review>(See pics)The zuchini cakes was really good. The moussaka my friend had was very rich and delicious. The lamb shank dish was too big of a dish like half of a lamb was there. It kinda killed my appetite just looking at it. I could only finish about half of it.The prices are very decent and it's such a big place that feels like somone's house with a nice fireplace.Bathrooms are in the basement and seeing the wines I was a bit surprised sine it was a fairly warm area and was wondering if the wines cellar was just properly separated in cooler temperature.Service was very good and friendly.</review>

        <review>Average experience. Two suggestions:1) Order a lot of appetizers instead of an entree. The main dishes are meh. I had some sort of creamy pie thing and my date had chicken and veggies... both okay at best. Share the octopus, eggplant and lamb apps instead. They are tasty bits worth sampling.2) Be weary of the waiters. Our server refused to give us an order of meatballs because we already had three appetizers on the table. He also refused to serve us a certain dessert because he thought the others were better. I thought he was joking at first but he was not. Loser.Hotel lobby ambiance, weirdo waiters and average entrees. Does it deserve all this Yelp praise? Maybe not, but if you stick to the appetizers and get a sane waiter, you'll probably enjoy it.</review>

        <review>Kokkari is a decent restaurant, but a bit overrated in my opinion. Maybe my expectations were a bit high ..The food was okay, but everything was so darn salty!The ambiance was definitely the highlight of this place - it's beautiful.I will probably not be making a trip back here in a while, not because I didn't like the place. The place just didn't blow me away, and there are too many other great restaurants out there to try in this great city.</review>

        <review>I had an interesting experience here. My mom and my grandma were visiting me from out of town so we came here for a nice dinner. I've never gone out to eat in the city with a 50 year-old woman and a 79 year-old woman, and let me tell you that most restaurants in this young city are not kind to older people. Pesce was the exception.I'll start with our service. Our waiter was some shouted at my grandma for the first half of our service then completely ignored her and addressed all questions to me when she looked confused (her hearing is fine; she couldn't figure out why this man was treating her like a 4 year-old). She asked for butter for her bread several times and never got it. I had planned on ordering a glass or two of wine and put in the order with the rest of our food. By the time our entrees arrived I had to cancel it because it still had not come. Unfortunately, our waiter refused to make eye contact with us because he was too busy schmoozing with the table next to us; they ordered bottles of wine. It took me a good 20 minutes to get his attention to cancel my drink. To his credit, he gave us free dessert in an effort to make up for this but I wasn't happy about washing down my lamb chop with a glass of water. The rest of the staff was fantastic though, and ended up attempting to pick up the slack. Onto the food...fantastic! The food is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars. When I come back, which I will do in spite of the horrible service, I will probably order all appetizers (Sorry Kristen, for not listening to you and just doing that in the first place!). We had incredible duck dolmathes, roasted butternut squash, and zucchini cakes. We split an a lamb chop special for our entree, which probably also contributed to our waiter's attitude. We ordered it cooked medium to medium-well for my mom and grandma and it came medium-rare (which I was happy about). Our [free] desserts were also delicious!There were a few more things that happened but I should stop complaining because we left full and satisfied but with a bad taste in our mouth (metaphorically, not literally). I'll come back without the old ladies and try again because I hate to think that a place that serves food that amazing can really deliver such an awful customer experience.</review>

        <review>Perhaps THE most reviewed restaurant I have also Yelped. Since everyone else is glowing, you know that the food and service are tops. But, here are few other items for your perusal.DURING LUNCH HOURS:- if you call for reservations, they won't have any, but if you just walk in, you will get seated. I know someone who works in a nearby office and they confirm that this is often the case.- suits and Nob Hill ambience galore. don't dress down. expect pearl necklaces. bad choice to bring your Greek punk rocker boyfriend even if it can get a bit noisy.- entrees from $16-30. salads $8-10'ish. starters $8- 12'ish. starters are small'ish and heavy on the fats. feta in the salad was Athenos brand, I swear, salt outweighed creamy 3-1.- not exactly brimming with vegetarian options. The service is white button down and tie, clearing occurs between courses in an unobtrusive manner and they understand the need for speed at lunch. The only reason that I didn't go for the 5 stars was that I have an built-in 'phoo' button for pretentiousness.</review>

        <review>Kokkari obviously has a stellar reputation so I went in with high expectations. Kokkari mostly lived up to my expectations -- great service, nice ambiance, impressive menu and wine list. The only thing lacking at Kokkari was a certain je ne sais quoi which I'll term a "flavor explosion". I tried many things off the menu: the grilled flatbread, lamb chops, zucchini cakes, pan fried Kefalograviera cheese and a few other things. Only the pan fried cheese came close to food orgasm status. I couldn't help but compare Kokkari to Aziza in my mind as I was having my meal. Although Aziza is Moroccan and Kokkari is Greek, the flavors and dishes are pretty similar. Aziza is unquestionably the superior restaurant out of the two. I just can't see myself going to Kokkari for dinner again as long as it's in the same city as Aziza.</review>

        <review>Service was impeccable, and the decor is nice. I've enjoyed the fish here, as well as the persimmon salad. The lamb is decent though not spectacular. Brussel sprouts were also okay but not great.</review>

        <review>Came here to celebrate two birthdays (one of them being mine!) with a group of friends.We were lucky enough to score a prime location close to the entrance though it made for a half-mile trek to the bathroom which boasted a nice private dining room nearby. The restaurant has a very rustic yet majestic feel to it, lots of oak and vaulted ceilings. Neither is it too over-the-top in your face with people smashing plates over their heads, yelling "Opa"! (I KNOW, I was secretly disappointed too. :p)For most of us it was our first time trying Greek food apart from the usual gyros with tzatziki sauce. There were a lot of "that sounds delicious" and "whadda hell's that!?" as we studied the menu, waiting for everyone to show up. The wait staff helped us to wade through the list of long named dishes to find something we liked. Some of their dishes may be a bit much for the squeamish, but our group was pretty adventurous so we had the lamb innards in a ruddy sauce, which were very soft and didn't smell offensive (as is usually the case with menudo). Tried the pork riblet appetizer but the sauce was practically the same. We also ordered the grilled calamari stuffed with feta cheese--although it sounds good, it was more of an arranged wedding rather than a marriage for love. Ordered the moussaka as my entre, packed with layers of ground lamb, potatoes, eggplant, which is delicious right up to the last bite, that is, if you make it that far. When they brought out the bowl, I looked at it, perplexed, wondering if the serving was large enough to make me full but no worries here (especially if you gorged on the appetizers like I did). Had a bite of the lamb shank which was so tender that the meat just fell off the bone.My only regret is not budgeting some room in my stomach for dessert! No "betsu bara" here (Japanese for, "having a second stomach reserved for dessert"). This place is a delight for those looking to take a break from the usual and is suitable for any special occasion. One minus star for the hit-or-miss appetizers but everything else more than made up for it!</review>

        <review>This is a KILLER lunch spot. You should absolutely get pita and dips to start. They have five and I tried all five. I would rank them in this order:TaramosalataTirosalataTzatzikiMelitzanosalataFavosalataDon't worry about what's in them (although the waiter will tell you if you ask), just get it. I generally don't even care about bread but their pita is pretty dope.The lamb chops are really expensive (for lunch at least) but delicious. I would suggest the Lamb Souvlaki unless you've got someone else paying for you. It's a skewer with lamb, tomatoes and onions with sides of pita and humus and a chickpea salad.It'd probably get five stars, but it was a bit pricey for a lunch. It's worth checking out if you've got something to celebrate or have someone else paying.</review>

        <review>I was reminded of this place while reading through a Yelp friend's review's Mister O. M. from Pacifica. I've had many great meals here and even a couple birthday celebrations. I like Kokkari, it's a good place but holy cow is it expensive. I used to know the wine director so I went there w/ friends for dinner - 6 of us, bought a bottle of wine then let him pick a bottle - my pick $60, his pick $150 smackaroons - maybe he thought we weren't spending enough w/ all of the apps, cocktails, and glasses of wine. Thanks dude - you're awesome!! Fortunately, he and his attitude are long gone from the place - I must say that I've liked everyone I've come across there - especially the bartenders - really great guys.</review>

        <review>Upon walking into Kokkari, I felt very underaged and under-dressed. The restaurant has a very cozy feel. It's dim and there's a lot of dark wood furnishing. Our bread was fresh and tasty but I will refrain from making a big deal out of it because I was hungry and probably not in the right frame of mind to evaluate its worthiness. We also got some olives. Had to ask for olive oil though.I had the hardest time hearing our server(s) speak! They spoke too softly and mumbled everything. Luckily when we asked for suggestions and the specials, the server was very enthusiastic and helpful.We started out with the zucchini cakes with mint cucumber yogurt sauce (via yelp consult) and lamb riblets (server recommendation). I had no idea what to expect for the zucchini cakes, which looked more like a baby cassoulet. There were beans and stuff in there too. It was definitely interesting; I'd never had anything like it. Its taste wasn't spectacular though. We much preferred the lamb riblets. So tender, so juicy, so tasty! We wanted to get a fish dish as well as a meat dish. Opted for the specials menu. We picked the local petrale sole with a lemony vinaigrette served with mustard greens and the pork shoulder with apples, served with rice and a yogurt sauce. The portions were huge. The petrale sole was delectable! Very light, very fresh, very tasty. Loved it. The pork shoulder was a huge contrast. Each piece of meat was very fatty. No matter how hard I tried to find lean meat to eat, every bite consisted of 80% fat. It did taste good though. The apples complement the pork very well. We loved the rice with the yogurt sauce! Though we were rather satiated, we couldn't pass up dessert. The special sounded fabulous but too heavy (phyllo, meyer lemon filling, pistachio ice cream, and some other good stuff). We opted for the Arborio rice pudding with a caramelized pear. It was quite good. The pear went well with the pudding, but definitely do not eat the pear by itself for it is SOAKED in flavor and its strength is overwhelming. The dessert selection is aplenty so be wise and save room! Or eat really slowly.Other notes: our food came out ridiculously fast. Especially the appetizers and dessert. Amazing. To get to the restroom is a journey in and of itself. An elevator is involved. The one time use hand towels are amazing but wasteful. Prices are reasonable for the quality, presentation, uniqueness, atmosphere and overall experience. Also very BART accessible.</review>

        <review>kokkari definitely met my high expectations in regards to food, the best lamb i've ever had (i hate lamb usually), and ambiance. however, i think our server sucked, or at least, was very new. not only was she slightly off putting, but she also answered a question COMPLETELY wrong in regards to the size of the ribeye. 2 of us at our table asked about how big the $40 ribeye was, not necessarily wanting to eat a huge dinner or bringing leftover meat for tomorrow's lunch. she initially answered a healthy 32oz, which would have made sense, but when we asked her to confirm, she came back saying 14oz very confidently. 14oz is definitely not much to tackle, so it was ordered....only for a huge 32oz looking steak to come shortly after. wtf! i'd imagine a well trained server, let alone someone who knows food, (as i expect all servers to know) can tell the difference between 2 pounds of meat and 14 oz. alas, it was still good and we had a good experience, but that server should definitely definitely get more training. there's not much more that can be said about the food that the other reviews didn't say, but i guess i just expected better service at such a restaurant. in the end, it's still easily one of the best, if not the best greek restaurant i've ever been to.</review>

        <review>The Background:Much like its sister restaurant in Palo Alto, this restaurant serves great food and has a strong focus on the lamb. The space is larger than the one in Palo Alto and the atmosphere seemed nicer.The Positives:The lamb chops are amazing. No surprise that they are among the most commonly mentioned items on here. In addition, I was a fan of the baby octopus. While I didn't order it myself, I am told the lamb stew was also quite good.The Negatives:Not really a negative but the zucchini cake I thought was overrated. They were good but weren't all that amazing which you would expect from all the recommendations for them.</review>

        <review>Alright, alright. Kokkari is great. I would not pass up eating here and the food is good. But is it real Greek food? No. Kokkari is fancy. Anytime you can call a Greek restaurant fancy you can also assume it's not authentic. Greek restaurans, inherently, are not fancy. Greeks grub, they get down, and it's hard to get down with linen napkins.I'm rating this joint with 4 stars so clearly I'm not dissing. I'm just saying... San Francisco could use a grubbin Greek restaurants. Anyone, anyone?</review>

        <review>We ate here for Valentine's Day, for which they offered a price-fixe menu. We were pretty excited considering the glowing reviews on Yelp, and I have to say, we weren't too disappointed, although not overwhelmed. Having said that, I don't think we experienced the restaurant at its best.We arrived on time for our 9:30 reservation, and were told by the delightful hostess that there was a 15-20 minute wait - which meant we would be eating at almost around 10 pm. I didn't mind too much - I like sitting at the bar before a meal. The problem was that there was no seating at the bar, and there was nowhere that was not awkward to stand either. Not their fault, I suppose, although it would be nice if they had some way of more graciously handling this.The price of a glass of wine was a little breathtaking. My Viogner was pleasant but not really more outstanding than a wine I've paid less for elsewhere. My partner's Merlot was pretty exceptional, however. We were seated between a server station and a rather loud couple - not really conducive to a romantic Valentine's Day meal. I was bumped into a number of times by servers passing by - I schooched our table in a little toward the loud couple to alleviate this - my partner and I didn't need to talk, much, anyway :) Next time I will request a booth.Our main server, who was really quite wonderful, explained how our menu would be served, what would be brought automatically and what we could choose (the entree and desserts). He offered us tap water (which I thought was a little manipulative, because who wants to drink tap water? Why not filter it?) and I asked for panna, which was also quite pricey. We were brought a little dish of marinated olives - I think usually this comes with some bread, which would have been nice, since the olives were very salty. I much preferred the meaty, firm Kalamata olives that came with the appetizers and salad. We began with a dish of spreads: melitzanosalata - a delicious eggplant relish reminiscent of babaganoush but less creamy, more fresh and chunky; tzatziki - a wonderful creamy yoghurt and cucumber spread, redolent with garlic; and a lovely fresh and light taramosalata, a dip made from smoked cod or carp roe blended with lemon juice, olive oil and a little bread, one of my favorite things, and now one of my partner's favorites :) This was served with little warm flaky buttery triangles of spanikopita, fresh cuke spears, passable dolmathes (I like mine better) and fresh fluffy pita bread. Next, they brought us a classic Greek salad which featured an incredibly special feta - creamy and 'sheepy', very fresh. I did not like the tomatoes, which could have been riper, and would have been better if they were not refrigerated - they were a little mealy. This was followed by grilled octopus, which was something in between what I've had before and what the most glowing Yelp reviews report - a tiny bit chewy, but not unpleasantly so, yet not outstanding. I refer to my earlier qualifier. It must have been a stressful night for the restaurant.Once the lamb riblets arrived, I was beginning to feel as if more food was a bad idea. They were nicely prepared, not overly spiced, just a little olive oil and lemon - I wished for a little bread to mop up the juices and oils, but the pita was long gone :( For our entree, we ordered the "Thalasina Scharas Yia Dio - mixed seafood grill for two of whole Mediterranean sea bass, prawns, mussels, &amp; calamari, roasted fennel &amp; braised gigante beans with black olive" (there was no black olive). I was really too full at this point to enjoy the subtle flavors of the perfectly-cooked seafood - I had a little of everything but we ended up taking most of it home. The roasted fennel was lovely - I usually braise it but I really enjoyed the firm texture and fresh flavor of the roasted veggie. I wish there had been more of that.Strangely enough, when it came time for dessert, my brain overrode my tummy and temporarily I had room for just a bit more. My partner ordered the baklava, which came warm with vanilla praline ice cream. I joked with him that I bet it would not be as good as my homemade version but it really was! I ordered the Galaktoboureko. The word 'sumptuous' accurately describes this dessert - two cigars of buttery, flaky phyllo surrounding a rich semolina custard, Meyer lemon spoonsweet (which was sort of like a marmalade but with thicker slices of Meyer lemon, truly divine) &amp; crme fraiche ice cream. We shared a glass of lovely citrusy Eiswein that perfectly complimented the desserts.I believe we'll come back for appetizers and maybe share an entree - the food is very good, authentic; the prices for bevvies are too high (Kokkari, please consider offering filtered water!). The atmosphere and service are really excellent, although I will be assertive about requesting a quieter, less vulnerable spot next time :)</review>

        <review>This is an absolutely great find! I love Evvia in Palo Alto and this sister restaurant reminds me a lot of it. Perfect for an upscale-casual downtown business lunch but I will also add this to the rotation with the gf.I was here with four colleagues from work and all had great meals. I started with the beet salad which was hearty but cool and refreshing. I also had the short rib special, served over orzo - absolutely outstanding. I tried the stuffed calamari appetizer, which was perfectly prepared - tender and juicy.I will definitely return to try more appetizers and sample some desserts. Four stars for now but I will give Kokkari an opportunity to earn the fifth!</review>

        <review>Kokkari, I love your food, but your skin lamp shades make me think of serial killers. They are creepy. And they are *everywhere*. Every table is within 3 feet of a creepy skin lampshade. Kokkari, Your fried cheese appetizer makes me drool. And your Kokkari sundae is amazing. But, seriously, get rid of the skin lamps. It is almost enough to make me stop coming back. Who did your decorating? Who thinks skin lampshades are a good idea?</review>

        <review>Another restaurant who folds my napkin, when I step away to use the restroom. EXTRA star for this one! The service is SUPERB! Everyone was so nice, polite, friendly and attentive. Because we weren't seated on time, they actually gave us free appetizers to start. We also ordered the crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber that was topped with mint-yogurt dressing. I def recommend trying the zucchini cakes. It was like a big crab cake, but made with zucchini. I'm not a big fan of lamb, I wish I was, because they are known for their lamb dishes. So I put myself on the safe side and ordered the charcoal grilled, dry aged rib eye with braised greens and potatoes.  Portions are huge here and is recommended to do family style. I was only able to finish 1/3 of it, but I did bring it to go and was able to have the $42 steak for lunch the next day. People were dressed nicely and a bit on the older side. If you are expecting a hip, loud, young diners crowd; this place may not be for you. The restroom is located downstairs and I had to take an elevator down. This was fun, exploring how big the restaurant was. Our table was seated right infront of the cooking area and I was able to see all the dishes come out and how the staff work. This was actually the most exciting part of my dinner experience. I wish my party had time to stay for dessert, but we had reservations for boubon and branch. We def didn't want to miss out on this secret password bar. I WILL BE BACK!</review>

        <review>shrimp: delish but tangy with tomato sauce.grilled calamari: it was stuffed with feta cheese - interesting but couldn't take too much. pita bread with feta dipping: yuuuuum.oven roasted chicken: juicy and very flavorful.very authentic place (haha, my first mediterranean experience actually, but i thoroughly enjoyed it!) i thought for the ambiance, portions, and good eats - the price was acceptable - not fancy smancy not worth it kinda expensive.</review>

        <review>Kokkari Estiatorio has been on my Yelp bookmarks list for what seems like ages so I was extremely excited to find out that we were dining there for our department luncheon. For starters we shared numerous plates of the grilled meatballs, calamari, and the cheese pies. The grilled meatballs were definitely a favorite of mine and my coworkers. They are tiny meatballs, grilled, and topped with a spicy tomato sauce and greek yogurt. The calamari and the cheese pies were both pretty good but the meatballs totally stole the show. I would definitely recommend these appetizers.For my entree, I ordered the chicken souvlaki. The chicken souvlaki was grilled and marinated with greek yogurt, peppers and onions and was extremely flavorful! It came with a side of romaine salad and also some pita bread and tzatziki for dipping. I completely devoured the whole plate, it was that delicious! My coworkers ordered various dishes from the moussaka to the halibut. Everyone loved their food!We, of course, saved room for dessert and coffee. I had the sokolatina which is a flourless chocolate cake and it came with a huge side of whipped cream. It was very sweet, especially when paired with the whipped cream, and I found it a little too sweet for my liking but it was nevertheless delicious.Service was great from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. He was even happy to check with the chef about some food ingredients since I'm deathly allergic to pine nuts. The staff are very nice and efficient and make you feel comfortable - just like you're eating at a cozy home in Greece.I will definitely be back! Well deserved 5 stars all around.</review>

        <review>What else can you say about this place when 800+ people have already said it? Just come here and see for yourself! A group of four of us came and had an extremely reasonably priced and beyond filling dinner out of appetizers we shared family style - beets, butternut squash, a salad, meatballs, and calimari. Don't skip the deserts! We had a great recommendation on a Macedonian wine which oddly enough was featured in Food and Wine Magazine this month. The ambiance, waitstaff, entire menu and experience were one of the best I've ever had, anywhere - I was just blown away.</review>

        <review>We were here for lunch and found everything about it (with the exception of the prices...not cheap but for once you get what you pay for) to be wonderful. We ate a sampling of appetizers, I had a delicious salad with beets and my co-worker had a lamb dish. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. It is obvious they mix up the menu as new seasonal ingredients become available. My two standout favorites were the Lamb Riblets and this eggplant dip we got when I asked about babaganush. The riblets were so good I started exploring how I would go about making them. They were braised then seared and were simply delicious with classic greek oregano and lemon seasoning. The eggplant dip was chunkier than a babaganush and had a lot of dill. I love dill and I love eggplant and I had never had them together like this. A unique treat for sure.The other thing we really enjoyed was our waiter. He was obviously a professional. He at one point daintily used a butter knife to swipe the crumbs off our tablecloth. Slick. He was also just sort of witty and snarky. He was so good and so fun I think he actually made the food taste better. I now have a new tourist activity I am onto...I have discovered I love eating really good food in strange towns served by someone who is decidedly local. My iconic LA waiter was just as delightful but nothing like the iconic San Francisco waiter who made our day. I would eat at Kokkari again and am really glad we tried it.</review>

        <review>BEST food I've ever tasted, bar none. I wished my stomach was bigger so I could eat more. The food was VERY rich however, and I couldn't eat at all the next day. It's also a high-end restaurant with a full bar (usually Greek food isn't at high-end restaurants).Best Appetizers (in order of amazing, from most to least, but least was still better than 75% of restaurants)* Tzatziki &amp; Favosalata with Pita - OMG. I kept eating these, they were incredible. Never in my life have I tasted such pita! It was pillowy, soft, and had the slightest hint of herbs. Dear Lord, I hope Heaven's restaurant serves such good pita. Otherwise all my charity work would have been in vain.The tzatziki is incredibly rich &amp; creamy, with pieces of dill &amp; cucumber, I'm pretty sure they used whole milk Greek yogurt. Tasted a lot like high-end cream cheese.Favosalata - take the BEST hummus you've ever tasted. Now multiply it X 1000 and you've got the taste of their favosalata. It was rich, creamy, and tart. * Saghanaki - fried cheese. It's not feta, but it tastes a lot like a combination of feta &amp; parmegiano reggiano. It was incredible. It's soaked in lemon and olive oil, but the cheese is crispy so it's a mix of crispy &amp; soft textures. It's very tart but strangely addictive. * Dolmathes - grape leaves stuffed with rice, dill &amp; mint. Usually most restaurants make these too bland or too vinegar-y. These were the most perfect dolmathes I have ever tasted - just tart enough without being too tart.* Soutzoukakia - lamb meatballs in marinara &amp; Greek yogurt. Think meatballs with VERY concentrated lamb flavor.My entree:I got Souvlaki apo Entosthia, which is organ meats on a skewer, with spiced potato wedges. Sounds unappetizing, right? Most of my colleagues got lamb, and it was pretty average. But organ meats are very rich, creamy, and fatty, with highly concentrated flavor. One of the other people at my dinner party tried my dish, and said it was MUCH better than the external cuts of lamb. The spiced potato wedges were comparable to KFC's but less salty, they were very good.I finished off the meal with regular coffee.There's a few things you should NOT order: Appetizers: * Melitzanosalata (an eggplant dip like baba ganoush which was very bland)* Octapodaki - grilled octopus, these tasted like grilled chicken and were nothing extraordinary. I expected them to be slimy like calamari but they had the same texture &amp; taste as chicken. * Brussels sprouts (tasted too smoky for me)Desserts:* Rizogalo - rice pudding with roasted peach. It was far too sweet, and tasted like over-sugared oatmeal* Greek coffee - it had no flavor and lots of grounds. (if you want coffee - get the regular coffee, that was fine)</review>

        <review>I had a fantastic meal here the other night! A few gal pals and I popped in for some great Greek food and beyond just tasty food we had wonderful wine and outstanding service from our waiter, Jeff. With a little bit of guidance from Jeff the 4 of us sampled various small plates of some popular dishes and found everything to be absolutely delicious. Beyond what we ordered Jeff even brought out an extra little plate of pickles for us because we'd made a comment that they were really good. Totally above and beyond anything we expected! That small gesture was so generous and thoughtful that the already 5-star experience was just that much better.Topping the night off with baklava ice cream, I don't think I've had a better meal in SF in quite a while! Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town.</review>

        <review>Finally. Finally, finally, finally.Kokkari Estiatorio has been on my mind for a while now and I finally dragged my mom and I over there on January 3rd. I've always loved Mediterranean food, but usually opt for cheaper choices like La Mediterranee, Sunrise Deli or Oasis Grill for my falafel, lamb, or hummus fixes.We made a reservation the day before and headed over there around 11:45am the next morning for lunch. It was nice that it was a weekday and quiet so that we were able to get quick service and have room and time to chat.The ambiance is wonderful- cushiony chairs, a warm fireplace with huge loaves of freshly baked bread, gigantic flower arrangements, dark wood and a glittering full bar.We were promptly seated near the fireplace and brought bread and water. Our service was attentive which I enjoyed, but my mom said it made her feel uncomfortable that they were there right away anytime you needed them! Haha. We had our choice of flat or sparkling water and we also ordered tea. Keep in mind, tea here was 5.00 a pot. We should have just ordered one kind and split it. I got chrysanthemum and mom got sencha.Food-wise we decided to get a bunch of different things and share. Lamb riblets were amazing- tiny, tender, and not gamey at all with a little bit of a crisp. Zuchinni cakes were nicely dense, crunchy, and served with a cooling yogurt sauce and cucumbers. The Greek salad was good, but we could have passed on it as it was something I could have made at home- generous chunks of tomato, cucumber, and feta, dressed with slivered red onions, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. For our entree we shared their moussaka which was amazing!!! Perhaps a bit too heavy and rich for such a warm sunny day and for lunchtime, but nevertheless the portion was enough to share and bring home. A casserole of ground lamb, potatoes, tomato, and eggplant with a wonderful tangy bechemel sauce baked on top. Oh, halfway through we also ordered pita which was grilled, warm, and thick! We were too full for dessert, so I hope the next time I go, I'll be able to taste those!!I was worried that lunch would be expensive, but it ended up being quite reasonable at 60.00 for the two of us for lunch. It could even be a great tapas place since they have so many yummy small plates to share.Overall, wonderful service, authentic food, and a nicer atmosphere than the usual SF mediterranean joints. Oh, they also have space for party rentals!! Can't wait to return and try more!</review>

        <review>I came here with a Greek family who frequent this restaurant for yearrrrssss. I guess they had to through some Greek weight around to get us in on Saturday night.The decor is very Old World, but still clean and crisp. The place is much bigger than you would imagine walking in. There is a larger dining room in the back. To get to the bathroom, you have to go down an elevator (as typical in San Fran - bathroom always up or down). On the lower level, there are two private dining rooms and wine cellars. I felt like I was in an old castle!I heard tons of hype about Kokkari before our visit, and I was not disappointed! The manger, Demetri, was very nice when we arrived. Although our table wasn't ready, he invited us back to this wine island, so that we felt "more welcome". He checked on us a couple times throughout the meal.Chris was our waiter. He knew the menu and specials like the back of his hand. It was apparent he is an expert his profession. Although, he did seem a little stressed out with several large parties in his section. It seemed like he needed one more bus boy/helper.We ordered.... everything. We started with feta cheese and olives for the table. The feta was wondrous like nothing I've had before. Then, octopus salads. The octopus was charred and the dressing was perfect, not too heavy. Apparently, this is only on the lunch menu, but we called ahead to make sure we could all have it for dinner. I ordered the lamb chops at Chris' suggestion. I've never had such amazing lamb!!! One person in our party said to Chris, "I am going to let you surprise me!" - Chris brought him the 22 oz bone in ribeye steak, blackened with lemon sauce. Seriously, WORDS DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE!For dessert, we got everything! Galaktoboureko, Milo Furnisto, Baklava and Rizogalo. All FANTASTIC!!! Not your typical desserts, but then again it was my first true Greek dining experience.The place was packed even when we left at 10:30! I am wondering if they did 3 or even 4 seatings that night.BOTTOM LINE: Do not miss Kokkari! Fantastic dining experience. Plan in advance and make a reservation.</review>

        <review>I came here with two of my sisters for one of their birthdays and I wasn't sure want to expect because she's super picky and a vegetarian too. I hadn't really tried greek or mediterranean before either.To start off, I loved the fancy and high-end feel to the place. Lights were dim, but with open windows for a fresh breeze. Everything was decorated nicely and you could see the kitchen too, so it wasn't a secret of what's happening with your food. Our waitress was SO friendly too. She noticed we all had wristbands (for the beer garden after the SF marathon) and when we told her what it was for, she was so enthusiastic about what we were doing. She kept congratulating us and asking questions, and even if she didn't really care, it was nice of her to pretend!I ordered the lemon chicken and was seriously blown away. I've never had such a simple dish be so delicious! The meat was tender and flavorful in every bite, and the lemon on the side was so nicely arranged in a cloth to keep the seeds out. Not only was it mouth-watering, it was a huge serving! Even when I heated the leftovers the next day, it was still as juicy and tender and yummy as the day I first ordered it. It is on the higher end of the price spectrum, but I say it's worth it!</review>

        <review>SUCH GOOD GREEK FOOD. z0mg. So I read the reviews beforehand, and I got excited because people had so many good things to say! And, all the reviews DEFINITELY lived up to my expectations, and more. They did a fantastic job of accommodating my friend's party, and even cut the cake, garnished the plates, and served it for us!</review>

        <review>I love Kokarri because the greek food, service and ambiance are consistently outstanding! I've brought many of my out of town family and friends to this place on several occasions and everybody has loved it too. You know you've found a gem of a restaurant when it's universally loved. I've eaten everything on the hot and cold small plates menu (lamb riblets, smelts, grilled shrimp, grilled octopus, spanakoptia, hummus, baba ghanoush, fresh baked pita bread, etc.) and they're all excellent. And their lamb chops and fish of the day entrees are great. I don't give out many 5 stars but this place earned it.</review>

        <review>Walking into Kokkari is like walking into a friends house...actually let me re-phrase that, it's like walking into a rich friends house, ok fine it's like walking into a really nice homey feeling house. The chairs are big and comfortable, the lighting is dim, there is a big open fire and there is an open kitchen. It seems as though there are no bad seats in the whole restaurant &amp; the bar looks very relaxing and intimate.After reading all of the reviews and hearing all the hype about Kokkari, I thought for sure I was going to be disappointed, but I was definitely WRONG! The wait staff and hostesses were awesome, they were really friendly and were everywhere, when you needed them, but out of sight at the same time...is that even physically possible? I guess so! It was probably the best service I have ever had at any restaurant, which says a lot. As for the food, it was equally amazing! The zucchini cakes with dill sauce were awesome (I am craving them right now) and the spanakotiropita (spinach, filo dough &amp; cheese) were very good as well.For my main course I ordered fish that came with potatoes, pomegranate seeds and whole cloves of garlic, which was delicious. The rib-eye steak was also really good and was served with spinach and potatoes. I wish we had ordered desserts, but we were too full. I guess I will have to go back soon...like I have to force myself. I would definitely recommend ordering a bunch of appetizers and maybe splitting entrees so that you can try more things on the menu since EVERYTHING looks awesome!Everything from the service to the atmosphere to the food was perfect, and as hard as I try to find something wrong with the restaurant I can't (besides for the high prices), but I still definitely think it is worth every penny and I can't wait to go back!</review>

        <review>As a graduation present, my two dearest family friends took my boyfriend and I here for dinner a few weeks ago. This was the same restaurant where they had gotten engaged, and they'd had their engagement party in a private room here, so clearly it's a fan favorite. And now Kokkari has 2 more devotees! The ambiance, the service, the cocktails, the wine, and the INCREDIBLE food all made for a wonderful and memorable dining experience. I clearly don't have to explain much more in detail as the nearly 2000 reviews speak for themselves. Will definitely be returning to commemorate another occasion in the [hopefully] near future!</review>

        <review>What can I say that other yelpers haven't? EXCELLENT food, atmosphere, and service = 5 starsThis place truly lives up to the hype. I've had lunch here once and it was good, but dinner was fantastic! Sure, I can't pronounce ANY of the names on the menu, but pointing always helps!- Spanakotiropita: these little filo triangles are absolutely delicious! nice flaky shell and a cheesy spinach filling that will melt in your mouth.....YUM!- Soutzoukakia: the meatballs were good and saucy, just the way I like 'em!- Kokinisto me Manestra: one of the best lamb shanks I've ever had! full of flavor, tender, the orzo was really good too. an absolute MUST TRY!!!- Wine: Peter Franus Zinfandel = excellentOur server was slightly difficult to understand with his accent, but he was wonderful, charming, and attentive. The bathroom is an adventure of it's own, just like Boulevard, where you walk all the way to the back of the restaurant, take an ELEVATOR down (yes, I'm not kidding!), and tada! it's a few steps away after you get off the elevator. Either than that, this place is wonderful for any occasion and can accommodate big groups!</review>

        <review>BIRTHDAY DINNER: 12.26.11 @ 5:45 PMGREEK FOOD AT ITS FINESTThe day after Christmas and the streets of Financial District were mesmerizing with an eye-catching fiery orange Christmas Tree (one of the many) and bright lights -- blue, white, green--that made the trees sparkle. My guy and I admired the holiday scene that surrounded us. It was a cold and quiet evening but the scene was breath-taking, almost magical.The nice stroll set the mood for what was yet to come--an equally magnificent birthday dinner at Kokkari. His birthday, not mine; but I wanted to make him feel special. And Kokkari provided the perfect venue.AMBIANCE/DECOR: http://www.yelp.com/biz_Kokkari was beautiful, old-world and rustic. The interior was decorated in earth tones with thick wood, exposed wooden beams, high ceilings, copper pots and brick walls. It was a nice treat to be seated with a full view of the wood-fire oven where a whole lamb and 1/2 dozen chickens were slowly roasting in the fireplace. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ The chairs were luxuriously comfortable padded seats.Kokkari was divided into 2 sections and bi-leveled. We sat in the dining room where the wood-fire oven and bar were located. It was cozier than the bigger although equally handsome dining room. A private dining room is located in the lower level where the bathroom was also located via the elevator.SERVICE:While the venue was classy, the friendly service made one feel comfortable and relaxed. Service was very attentive, professional yet accompanied by genuine smiles. Our glasses were never half empty, dishes were removed as if on cue and our server even helped us to our coats at the end of the meal.DRINKS:I had a Cosmopolitan ($11) pre-dinner and a glass of Napa '08 Cabernet with my lamb. The Cosmo was well-made, not sweet and strong while the Cab was generously poured and silky.FOOD:MUSHROOM WITH FRIED KEFALOTIRI CHEESE $12: Sauteed fresh mushrooms served with fried Greek cheese. *The tenderness of the mushroom was a nice compliment to the slighly chewy cubed cheeses. A nice 2 in 1 treat!GRILLED ARTICHOKE AND EGGPLANT SKEWERS (AGINARES SOUVLAKI) $12: Served with Greek yogurt - $12*Delicious in its simplicity. This dish celebrated the earthy tastes of the vegetables. LAMB ROTISSERIE $32: Spiced lamb skewer grilled with roasted potatoes.*Probably the best lamb dish that I have ever had. Simply grilled, big tender chunks of slow-roasted lamb cubes. Moist with the faintest hint of the natural gamey taste of the lamb. The potatoes were a meal in themselves. They were big chunks of crispy on the outside but tender on the inside roasted potatoes. I really enjoyed this meal. http://www.yelp.com/biz_DRY-AGED RIBEYE STEAK (MOSHARISIA) $42- charcoal-grilled, dry-aged rib-eye with braised greens &amp; Kokkari potatoes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_*The Birthday Man's meal. His eyes turned big when he saw the big piece of steak and potatoes placed in front of him. He enjoyed every bite and had to take home the rest. I even got to try the steak when I turned them into a steak sandwich the next day. He enjoyed it the second time around. I gnawed on othe bone and fatty parts-- tender perfectly medium rare oozing with its natural juices and perfectly seasoned in subtle Greek spices. A perfect piece of Ribeye!KOKKARI SUNDAE (COMPLIMENTARY) - chocolate &amp; vanilla ice cream with hot fudge, whipped cream &amp; toasted hazelnuts - $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_*Just a simple sundae but well-made and nicely presented with a blue candle on top. This was the Birthday Man's requested birthday dessert. Nothing exotic but a sweet way to end a perfect birthday meal!VERDICT:Since the important person in this review was the Birthday Man, his opinion was heavily solicited. He said it was a perfect meal and enjoyed every aspect of it--from the classy venue to the gracious service to the perfect piece of steak.Kokkari knows its lamb and how to roast a perfect piece of meat. For your lamb or steak dining needs or even for a really fabulous Greek meal, Kokkari is your place. You are guaranteed to like the food here even if you shy away from meat. I know because I have been to Kokkari before. There will be a 3rd visit and more. Kokkari does know how to make one feel special on their special day. They comped us the Kokkari Sundae and every staff who dropped by our table greeted him "Happy Birthday."Thanks, Kokkari.CHECK: $175 with 20% tip, 2 Pellegrino and hefty leftovers for lunch the next day.ADDICTIVE FACTOR: Make sure to try the lamb and/or the ribeye.</review>

        <review>I chose this place for my boyfriend's birthday based on the strength of Yelp reviews. We were not at all disappointed. He had the goat stew (I think it was a special that night) and I had the lamb shank. Our appetizers were to die for - the calamari is unlike any calamari I've ever had.Extra points to the staff for the birthday touches. I'd noted on the Open Table reservation that we were celebrating a birthday. The waiter asked whose birthday it was, and when desserts were brought out, Happy Birthday was written on my boyfriend's plate (in chocolate sauce) and there was a candle. I didn't say a word, it just happened. Nice touch ... a nice subtle acknowledgment befitting such a nice place.And oh the place - so warm, so inviting - something about it just felt classy yet homey. I felt very comfortable there - super nice but not pretentious in the least. Also, points for seating us right away even though we ended up getting there 30 mins early. I realize that's just a function of table availability, but it was still appreciated (even though we would have been happy to hang out in the cozy bar area, too).</review>

        <review>Gorgeous restaurant that was the perfect setting for my new gf and I on 'date night in San Francisco'. As romantic as the very thought sounds, Kokkari magnified the imager by serving rich dishes, nectarous wine, and classy service in an engaging atmosphere. Highly recommended if you want to make a great initial impression in a comfortable, sincere setting.</review>

        <review>Just came back from a wonderful dinner at Kokkari. When I called this week to reserve a table....they were booked, but the hostess was able to fit me in tonight for a 6:00 dinner.When we sat down, the restaurant was filled with gorgeous, beautiful people as always.......I just love checking out the ladies in their pretty outfits and heels.Oh well, we ordered the roast goose and my fav dish, the succulent and flavorful bone in rib eye steak.  The goose was prepared like their duck.....very rich, fatty and super tasty.  The rib eye steak (20 ounce) wassooooo flavorful.......full of pepper spices. Although this is not a steak house, its rib eye steak is as good as Morton's, Ruth's Chris or any other prime steak house.For desert, we had the baklava w/ ice cream and flourless chocolate cake w/ whipped cream. Both items were super good and finshed the meal with wonderful sweet flavors.Another great Greek meal!</review>

        <review>Kokkari is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love sitting at the bar but it is usually full. The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. The restaurant is pretty big yet it has a nice, cozy vibe to it. Everything was tastefully decorated, even the bathrooms. I definitely look forward to my next visit.</review>
